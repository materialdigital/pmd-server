[pyiron](https://pyiron.org) is an integrated development environment (IDE) for computational materials science. It integrates several computational/analysis tools in a common platform and provides various functionalities for creation, management and sharing of your workflows. 

## GitHub repository
In our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/materialdigital/pyiron_workflow_environment_deployment), you obtain the configuration files, needed for the deployment of a pre-configured jupyterhub to run pyiron workflows.

### Content of the repository

| File | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| `config.json` | a json file containing the configurable environment variables: keycloak client details, name of pyiron docker images, users' resources, and Postgres database Password |  
| `static.json` | a json file containing the non-configurable environment variables |  
| `nginx/pyiron.conf` | A template of the configuration file for the Nginx reverse proxy |  
| `docker-compose.yml` | the compose file, which runs jupyterhub and its Postgres database services. |  

## Deployment Guide
### The infrastructure, OS and other required packages
As an infrastructure, the deployment requires:  
- A server running a Linux operating system
- Installation of docker engine and docker-compose
- Adequate resources for running jupyterhub: (>2GB of RAM + 2 VCPU)
- The users' resources on the server should be proportional to the number of users (~2GB of RAM, 2VCPU, 10GB of storage per users)

### Assumptions
- For the authentication of the users, keycloak is assumed as the authentication provider. Therefore, a client id and secret are needed.
- Here, it is assumed that all the jobs are run on the same server as the jupyterhub.
- The configuration of the hostnames is assumed to be done separately by the admin, e.g. creating the A-record, etc

### pyiron docker images  
In the configuration file `config.json`, it is needed to pass in a set of pyiron docker image. pyiron offers various docker images corresponding to its modules, atomistics, continuum, md, ... . The docker images are available on docker hub: [https://hub.docker.com/u/pyiron](https://hub.docker.com/u/pyiron), and the corresponding dockerfiles can also be found via [https://github.com/pyiron/docker-stacks](https://github.com/pyiron/docker-stacks).   

### Nginx configuration
For the Nginx reverse proxy, you need to provide a configuration file, e.g. `pyiron.conf`. A template of such file is provided in the repository under `repo_path/nginx/pyiron.conf`  
After adding the domain, and the path to the SSL certificates and key (as described [here](reverse_proxy.md)), you should copy it to the nginx directory:
```bash
cp nginx/pyiron.conf ../data/nginx/
```
Of course, here it is assumed that the PMD-S core repo is the parent directory of the pyiron deployment directory.

### Adding pyiron client to Keycloak
For configuring the hub to authenticate the users via keycloak, you need to create a client in the keycloak instance. You can create the client via the following steps:  
1) Signing in as the admin of the keycloak instance  
2) Select your desirable realm  
3) Select clients from the left panel  
4) On the top right-hand side, select create  
5) Enter a client ID, and a root URL. For the URL, you should provide the url of pyiron  
   ![](../../assets/images/adding_keycloak_client.png)  
6) click save    
7) In the setting tab, change the access type to confidential, and save  
8) From the credential tab, you can obtain the client secret  

### Customizing `config.json`  
According to the configuration of your pyiron server and the keycloak instance/client, the values for the given keys in the `config.json` file should be adjusted. 

The keys are:  
- `OAUTH2_TOKEN_URL`: Keycloak Token URL; here you need only to change the domain and the realm
- `OAUTH2_AUTHORIZE_URL`:Keycloak authorize URL; here you need only to change the domain and the realm
- `OAUTH2_USERDATA_URL`: Keycloak userdate URL; here you need only to change the domain and the realm
- `OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`: Keycloak call back URL; here you need only to change the domain
- `CLIENT_ID`: The client ID defined in Keycloak
- `CLIENT_SECRET`: The secret for the client, provided from the Keycloak instance
- `PYIRON_BASE`: The relevant information of pyiron_base image in the form of `image_name:tag, e.g. pyiron/base:2021-06-04`
- `PYIRON_ATOMISTIC`: The relevant information of pyiron_atomistics image in the form of `image_name:tag, e.g. pyiron/pyiron:2021-06-04`
- `PYIRON_CONTINUUM`: The relevant information of pyiron_continuum image in the form of `image_name:tag, e.g. pyiron/continuum:2021-06-04`.
- `PYIRON_EXPERIMENTAL`: The relevant information of pyiron_experimental image in the form of `image_name:tag, e.g. pyiron/experimental:2021-06-04`
- `MEM_LIMIT`: The limiting amount of RAM per user
- `CPU_LIMIT`: The limiting amount of VCPU per user
- `ADMIN_USER`: The username of jupyterhub admin, this username should be consistent with the username in the keycloak instance
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: A password for the postgres database



For configuring pyiron, you need the keycloak domain, the realm, the client id, and the client secret.

### The process of the deployment  
It is assumed that the current working directory is the root of [PMD-S core repository](https://github.com/materialdigital/pmd-server).  

```bash
# clone the git repository
git clone https://github.com/materialdigital/pyiron_workflow_environment_deployment.git pyiron/

cd pyiron

# run the `config.py` script from the pmd-server parent directory
#in the case that python3 is installed on the host OS:
# python3 ../scripts/configure.py
# otherwise you can use a docker container to run the script via,
docker run --rm -v $PWD/:/tmp/ -v $PWD/../scripts/configure.py:/tmp/configure.py -w /tmp  python:3-alpine  python configure.py

# run docker-compose script via
docker-compose up -d 
```



## HPC connection (will be added soon)  
In principal, the pyiron docker containers can submit jobs to the cluster according to pyiron documentation in [here](https://pyiron.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/installation.html#submit-to-remote-hpc).
This feature will be added to pyiron docker images in the next release.

## Room for modification
Here we assumed a semi-automated deployment with minimal changes needed from the side of IT administrators. However, many things can be changed, such as:
- building a customized jupyterhub; this gives the possibility to change the jupyterhub configuration
- In the current setup, we assumed to have four jupyter environments based on: `pyiron_base`, `pyiron_atomistics`, and `pyiron_continuum`, `pyiron_experimental`. This list can be extended in the case of a customized jupyterhub build.
