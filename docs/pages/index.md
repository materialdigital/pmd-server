PMD Deployment Guide
===


## Preface
The PMD-Mesh is envisioned as a network of PMD instances acting as IDS Data Providers and Data Consumers. Every PMD instance has the same underlying base - A PMD Server (PMD-S).
While the architecture of the PMD-mesh is still work in progress, core functionalities of a PMD-S instance can already be deployed. The usage of docker and docker-compose for that purpose, ensures an easy transition of an initial standalone server into the PMD-Mesh.

> **Note:** firewalls and restrictive environments can cause various issues with the docker setup, which we are unable to foresee/test/cover. While we will try to help troubleshoot such issues, try to consult other online ressources as well. If you manage to find a solution without our help - Let us know and we can add it to the [Troubleshooting/FAQ](faq.md) section

## System Requirements
**Required:**
* A Linux x86-64 system (bare metal or virtualised) with at least 2 CPU Cores allocated
* At least 1GB of available disk space with additional space for applications
* Admin (root) privileges
* [Docker Runtime](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) >= 24.x
* [Docker Compose CLI Plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) >= 2.x
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* RAM >= 4 GB
* Activated Container support in the Kernel must be available

**Recommended:**
* Python >= 3.5
  - if not part of your system, python 3 can be installed via [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or run in a docker container

For a subsequent incorporation into the PMD mesh (WIP) it is advisable to fulfil the following requirement as well:
* Linux Kernel >= 5.6 or WireGuard kernel module (DKMS)

## Setup your environment
* make sure to install all the requirements
* if you haven't done so, ensure the [user is in the docker group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) (otherwise prefix all docker commands with `sudo`):
```bash
# Add user to docker group
# NOTE: this is equivalent to granting admin privileges
usermod -a -G docker $(whoami)
```
